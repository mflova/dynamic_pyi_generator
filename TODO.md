# TODO

- Create `TypedDict` with docstrings if those are present within a file
- Give the chance to store the custom class interfaces as local
- When a list of dictionaries is given, seafch for the keys in common and the ones that
  are not in common. Set as "NotRequired" for the ones that are not in common.
